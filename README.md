- **Final-Documentation**: The combination of documents from each sprint that make up the final document collection of the project

Additionally, there are the following loose files:
- **Submission-Links.txt**: This contains all relevant links pertaining to this project, i.e., the links to the YouTube demo, the hosted website, this GitHub organization, etc. This file is really only relevant for the Moodle Submission, as all these links can be found within this GitHub organization, and in previous sections of this document.
- **skillverse-documentation.md**: This is the documentation of the source code. It is also available as the README.md file in the Documents repository

### Source Code
This repo contains the source code for the project. It also contains a little bit of information about the project, and a README.md that details how to run the app locally.
